# HomeDepot_pre
As an intern candidate, I searched online about the most recent annual report and fiscal data of HomeDepot, analyzed potential pain points, and figure out a way to target at them from the perspective as a Data Science Intern.  

 I essentially want to showcase my passion to this internship opportunity, my enthusiasm to make a difference, my ability to solve problems, and what I can bring to HomeDepot.
